# Description
 This is a user based game to generate as much currency as they can to unlock all the upgrades.

# How to use
 Follow this link to access the application:

# How to play
 A user can click on the dollar bill icon to generate currency.
 Once a user has earned enough currency to unlock and upgrade, they may click that upgrade to increase the rate at which their currency is generating.
 There are a limited number of unlockable upgrades, and the system will notify the user once they have reached the limit for a given upgrade.

# FYI
 A user's  currency and upgrade will be tracked while they remain on the webpage, even if they refresh it. However, if a user exits the page, their current session play though will be erased and they will begin with zero currency and zero purchased upgrades.

# Technologies
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap
